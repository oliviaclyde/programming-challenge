#Programming Challenge
#Elevators in a building

#Number of elevators 2
#Number of floors 3

#I would first create each elevator as an object
#elevator1
#properties
#floor =
#door = open or closed
#status = occupied or not occupied
#total_trips =
#floors_traveled =

#elevator2
#properties
#floor =
#door = open or closed
#status = occupied or not occupied
#total_trips =
#floors_traveled =

#Would also need to provide for scaling the number of Elevators


#I would need to create an object called controller to initiate a call button to summon the elevator
#controller
def call ()

#call button is pushed on floor 1
#each elevator would need to relay what floor it is currently on
#each elevator would need to relay what status it is in
#elevator closest to
