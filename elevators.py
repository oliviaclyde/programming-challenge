#Elevators in a building

#Number of elevators 2
#Number of floors 3

#I would first create each elevator as an object
#elevator1
#properties
#floor =
#door = open or closed
#status = occupied or not occupied
#total_trips =
#floors_traveled =

#elevator2
#properties
#floor =
#door = open or closed
#status = occupied or not occupied
